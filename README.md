# Hello!
This is a Hackathon with absolutely no prerequistises apart from basic coding skills and competency in Googling.<br>The duration is from _0800 hours on 23rd May to 2000 hours on 24th May, with a 5 minute presentation by each team to be judged by seniors right afterwards_.

## Theme
The theme is "Life @ IIIT-H" and it reflects everything about IIIT! Feel free to make a software to optimize cab sharing, or to track debts in JC, a Tinder to find roommates or anything interesting! The important thing to realize is how you can use any language to build cool things to solve real world problems. You can use basic skills to build clever solutions like:
<ul>
  <li> A graph-based solution to optimize debts like splitwise, but accounting for internships/GSOC/DASA to make them pay more :pp.</li>
  <li> An OJ test-case generator, but generalized for any parameter. </li>
</ul>
These are just examples of the numerous ideas you can build upon. The goal is to enjoy and learn in the process, and then give and recieve feedback from the other teams.
  
## Team
Form teams of 3-5 members, and fill in the form: _form link_<br>
Try to prioritize similar technologies, and work together to make something cool.

## Submission
Each tean will get a repository in this organization and we recommend working on another working fork in your own account. You can always merge the two repos in form of a PR, and only the team leader will be able to do this. This should have a "Readme.md" file that should be the primary thing that will be presented in the Presentation phase.

## Prizes
The real treasure is the friends and skills you learnt on the way! Lmao yes really.
