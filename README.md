# Hello!
This is a Hackathon with absolutely no prerequistises apart from basic coding skills and competency in Googling.<br>The duration is from _0800 hours on 23rd May to 2000 hours on 24th May, with a 5 minute presentation by each team to be judged by seniors right afterwards_

## Theme
The theme is "Life @ IIIT-H" and it reflects everything about IIIT! Feel free to make a software to optimize cab sharing, or to track debts in JC, a Tinder to find roommates or anything cool!
